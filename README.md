This is a rewrite (well, a reverse engineering of a scanned PDF document) of the Color Computer 3 Basic Compiler manual by Bill Vergona of Cercomp, Las Vegas Nevada

It contains some corrections made by the community.

It is written in a text based markdown format that is compatible with ASCIIDOCTOR-PDF 

To create the PDF yourself, you would install RUBY and then use `GEM INSTALL ASCIIDOCTOR-PDF ` and then `GEM INSTALL ROUGE`

There is a WINDOWS POWERSHELL file  that will automatically create the PDF

Note: You can play around with the formatting and fonts used by modifying the YAML file in the `themes` folder.

Also, At this point... all the text is there... but there are some spelling a layout issues that need tweaking.
