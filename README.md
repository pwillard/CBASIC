This is a rewrite (well, a reverse engineering of a scanned PDF document) of the Color Computer 3 Basic Compiler manual by Bill Vergona of Cercomp, Las Vegas Nevada

It contains some corrections made by the community.

It it written in a text based mardown format that is compatible with ASCIIDOCTOR-PDF 

To create the PDF, you would install RUBY and then use GEM INSTALL ASCIIDOCTOR-PDF --pre and then GEM INSTALL ROUGE

There is a WINDOWS BATCH file `makeit.bat` and a Linux shell script file `buildit` that will automatically create the PDF
